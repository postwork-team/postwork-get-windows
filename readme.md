# get-windows

> Get metadata about the [active window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_window) and open windows (title, id, bounds, owner, URL, etc)

# For of get-windows.

Same as original except we added a Net Window Automation script to get the URL of the active window. To do that we added the Program.cs file and the build-urlfromwindow.yml builds that script into an exe file that
window.js can run.

To make changes to the script, you need to change the Program.cs file and then run the build-urlfromwindow.yml file to build the exe file, then replace the existing exe file in the bin/windows folder.

Works on macOS 10.14+, Linux ([note](#linux-support)), and Windows 7+.

## API

### activeWindow(options?)

Get metadata about the active window.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### accessibilityPermission **(macOS only)**

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Enable the accessibility permission check. Setting this to `false` will prevent the accessibility permission prompt on macOS versions 10.15 and newer. The `url` property won't be retrieved.

##### screenRecordingPermission **(macOS only)**

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Enable the screen recording permission check. Setting this to `false` will prevent the screen recording permission prompt on macOS versions 10.15 and newer. The `title` property in the result will always be set to an empty string.

### activeWindowSync(options?)

Get metadata about the active window synchronously.

## Result

Returns a `Promise<object>` with the result, or `Promise<undefined>` if there is no active window or if the information is not available.

- `platform` _(string)_ - `'macos'` | `'linux'` | `'windows'`
- `title` _(string)_ - Window title
- `id` _(number)_ - Window identifier
- `bounds` _(Object)_ - Window position and size
  - `x` _(number)_
  - `y` _(number)_
  - `width` _(number)_
  - `height` _(number)_
- `contentBounds` _(Object)_ - Window content position and size, which excludes the title bar, menu bar, and frame _(Windows only)_
  - `x` _(number)_
  - `y` _(number)_
  - `width` _(number)_
  - `height` _(number)_
- `owner` _(Object)_ - App that owns the window
  - `name` _(string)_ - Name of the app
  - `processId` _(number)_ - Process identifier
  - `bundleId` _(string)_ - Bundle identifier _(macOS only)_
  - `path` _(string)_ - Path to the app
- `url` _(string?)_ - URL of the active browser tab if the active window is a supported browser _(macOS only)_
  - Supported browsers: Safari (includes Technology Preview), Chrome (includes Beta, Dev, and Canary), Edge (includes Beta, Dev, and Canary), Brave (includes Beta and Nightly), Mighty, Ghost Browser, Wavebox, Sidekick, Opera (includes Beta, Developer, and GX), or Vivaldi
- `memoryUsage` _(number)_ - Memory usage by the window owner process

### openWindows()

Get metadata about all open windows.

Windows are returned in order from front to back.

Returns `Promise<Result[]>`.

### openWindowsSync()

Get metadata about all open windows synchronously.

Windows are returned in order from front to back.

Returns `Result[]`.

## OS support

It works on macOS 10.14+, Linux, and Windows 7+.

**Note**: On Windows, there isn't a clear notion of a "Window ID". Instead it returns the memory address of the window "handle" in the `id` property. That "handle" is unique per window, so it can be used to identify them. [Read more…](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632597(v=vs.85).aspx#window_handle>)

### Linux support

Wayland is not supported. For security reasons, Wayland does not provide a way to identify the active window. [Read more…](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45465016)

## Electron usage

If you use this package in an Electron app that is sandboxed and you want to get the `.url` property, you need to add the [proper entitlements and usage description](https://github.com/sindresorhus/get-windows/issues/99#issuecomment-870874546).
